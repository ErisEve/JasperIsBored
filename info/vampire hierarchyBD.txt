**Vampire hierarchy** 
*by age (and by proxy, power)*

1. **Malefactor** - only few in existence, oldest vampires in existence. You gain malefactor status when you have been alive for over a millennia. They are in hiding, and only appear during certain rituals. The crypts where they lie in stasis are known only to select few suzerain. Due to the high blood cost needed to sustain them, they hibernate and are only awoken with certain rituals once in a century or when their help is needed. Only 4 are known to exist currently.
2. **Suzerain** - the ruling hand, rules over an area, has a castle, makes laws for that area, deals with other suzerains by diplomacy. There is logically only one per castle. They usually only feed directly from people.
3. **Satrap** - at this tier, the vampire can turn vampires if given explicit permission by the suzerain. The satrap do most of the overseeing and regulation, they punish lawbreakers, give regular orders etc. A vampire is promoted to satrap from despot based on achievements. Satraps feed on fresher blood, either recently donated or directly taken.
4. **Despot** - vampires that have matured, regular population, the middle class. They still do not have the right to turn new vampires, but can petition for someone to be turned into one (a human lover etc). A vampire matures into despot from fledgling. Despots feed from blood given to blood cellars by volunteers. 
5. **Nestling** - newly turned vampires. absolutely forbidden from creating more vampires. Most transgressions they commit will be punished fiercely by their satrap. They are in servitude to the satrap that turned them. Vampires are nestlings for the first 20-50 or so years of their vampiric life. Nestlings usually feed on farm animals, unless they are sponsored/have friends in higher tiers.

Vampire who turned them - their **creator**. To the creator, vampire that was turned is their **scion**.
