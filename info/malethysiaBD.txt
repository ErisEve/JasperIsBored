**Malethysia**
Malethysia is a harmful branch of hemothysia. Casters are called malethysts. Spells in this group mostly include hexes and curses that are cast as ritual spells. They require certain ingredients and preparation, and casting these spells takes time. There are also spells that are cast in the moment, such as bloodboiling and bloodletting. These spells are more useful in combat, however they are more difficult to execute and can cause worse repercussions to the caster. This is another reason why fighting the vampires straight on is difficult for blood mages, as a lot of their magic isn't meant for direct confrontation. 
Casters of this type are more feared and shunned by humans, and as such, they usually stay in the safety of their homes.
