**Hemothysia**
The name of blood magic is hemothysia, and it mostly involves practices that have unharmful direct uses, although their price is still human blood. Casters are called hemothysts. The blood used can be either the caster's own blood or someone else's. Hemothysia depends on used components and is something that is done as a ritual with certain preparations, it is not something that is an instantaneous casting of a spell. Most hemothysic spells are spells of divination, clairvoyance, enchantment, healing and similar types. If you are trying to scry on a place or person, you might require some of their hair, a personal possession of theirs, a picture of a place or some of the soil. If you do not have the components, the spell is more difficult to execute, and needs a more powerful caster and a higher blood cost. 
Casters of this type are more welcome in human cities.
