- Known / unknown powers: advanced awareness (feel anyone in her close proximity) / — 
- Relationships:
    - Daireann, Yacenia, Nayeli, Searlas, Arix - hates them all
    - Synthra - doesn’t have a particularly great opinion of her, but can stand her and will definitely fuck with her
    - Laplace - a bit frustrated with him, unclear why to others, feels like she’s trying too hard whether to be on his good side or his bad side, very on and off relationship with him (friendship, companionship, or something more? Nobody knows)
    - Silvinius - hates him intensely
- Background: Due to unexplained circumstances, she ended up murdering  in cold blood the satrap that turned her, despite him (it is known that he was a man) being a whole lot older and stronger (in powers) than her. For this she was being judged by the holy court of Aunorel, and charged with capital felony, the highest degree of crime sentence that can be given. Her chest was seared with the mark of “unredeemable”, which soon became the reason why she was treated as persona non grata in most of the covens. Once she left Aunorel to escape the punishment, the first coven that would let her reside within its castle walls was Cariya, in which she became satrap suspiciously quickly and young, with only 34 years of vampire age.
- Ideals: believes vampires are above all other races and wants extinction of blood mages and imprisonment of humans into farms as livestock.
