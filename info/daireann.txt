- Relationships:
    - Yacenia - values the friendship they have and would do anything for her.
    - Nayeli - currently feels sorry for her because she heard of what happened
    - Mireio - can’t stand her, believes she should be punished for what she did and that she’s a person unworthy of redemption 
    - Searlas, Arix, Synthra - all too immature for her, she sees them as children roleplaying as suzerain and satraps
    - Laplace - doesn’t like him, will never insult him or flame him, but doesn’t want him in her presence 
    - Vitas - doesn’t have any strong opinions about him, but doesn’t vibe with him either
    - Silvius - doesn’t have any significant opinion on him because he never speaks
- Background: Has lived a very peaceful life in the mountains in the south of Nenthi. It is supposed that she had a vampire friend/lover that she helped, and who had turned her the moment they became satrap. It is yet unknown to Yacenia who that might be, but she knows that they are dead. Since then she has lived in coven of Nenthi, and when suzerain died suddenly without any reasonable explanation, so the satraps of Nenthi have chosen Daireann to lead them from now on because even though she was not the oldest at the time, she was the wisest out of them all.
- Ideals: believes in “live and let live” philosophy, doesn’t want conflicts and disputes over any means, but is also a strong believer in justice and capital felony, she thinks that not everything can and should be justified, and not everything should be forgiven to the criminals that have committed atrocious acts.
