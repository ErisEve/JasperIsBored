- known power: better awareness, real power: bat shape
- Relationships:
    - D: bff. They met decades ago while they were exploring nature and quickly became friends.
    - Synthra: thinks she's flirting with her as a joke, thinks she's like Searlass.
    - Searlass: loathes him.
    - Arix : doesn't like by association, isn't really on her radar.
    - Mireio : doesn't like her in support of D, doesn't actually mind her pro-vampire ideals.
    - Vitus : her biggest enemy, the suzerain. She can't be outwardly aggressive towards him though.
    - Alphonse and Santiago: the only men she can tolerate. They are gay bats. ðŸ¦‡
- Backstory: Her grandma Pleiada was a traditional mask maker who taught her the craft. Grandma was a human who lived in a human village in Odhran. Vitus' men tried to convince her to become the castle mask maker, but she refused. They killed her in retaliation when Yacenia was a teenager and made her work for them. Local villagers thought Yacenia was selling her body and blood to them and shunned her due to her connection to the vampires. She survived mostly by herself for years before asking to be turned, which was granted due to her service. She was turned by a random vampire who she doesn't even remember.
- Ideals : Unity - sees her fellow vampires as family. Her goal is to build unity and peace amongst the covens, starting from her own. She wants to dethrone Vitus, possibly by awakening Odhran the Castigator. She sees blood mages as an enemy of all vampires, and as such an easy common goal they can all agree on. She sees humans as weak pets, she doesn't wish them harm but they aren't her first priority.
