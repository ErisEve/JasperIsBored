- Background - As most vampires in Aunorel, he was an orphan with no remaining family. As such he was taken in by the Aunorel coven who raised him according to their traditions and turned him into a vampire when he turned 20. His strange demeanor was well received by the freaks in Aunorel who quickly kept promoting him. After he lived to be 135, he was the oldest vampire in Aunorel, and as such became suzerain. He has had that title for the last 15 years. 
- Ideals - Aunorel - plans to achieve supremacy by using Savardi as a tool of war and then disposing of them. Vow of silence to the unworthy - exceptions are to his advisors, to the malefactor and during ceremonials.
