**Athanasios**
- he/him,  pansexual, probably autistic (not confirmed)
- Vampire, satrap of Aunorel, the right hand to suzerain
- 20-30 human + 50-180 vampire years (apparently, nobody knows)
- Birthday: Trickster? Amulet? Wishbone? Nobody is sure
- Long white hair, mostly covering his face and almost looking like a wig, pale white skin
- known/unknown power: ?? / ?? 
- The most mysterious person in Aunorel
- Was rumored to have died and risen from the dead but nobody has yet confirmed any of those claims
- Very rarely talks or even responds to stimuli, it is rumored that he might be blind or/and deaf?? (nothing confirmed)
- Carries a coffin everywhere he goes, multiple human urban legends are about him, many vampires (despots and youngest of satraps) in the coven are scared of him
- Will randomly disappear entirely (sometimes for years) and return casually like nothing happened, will be confused why you are confused about his absence and will not elaborate further
- Relationships:
    - Silvinius - MY ONE AND ONLY MASTER
    - Thinks nothing special of others, and probably doesn’t even know how any of these people are called lmao
- Background: The creator of this weirdo died not much longer after turning him in unexplained circumstances, so nobody really knows anything about Athanasios. He was always kinda there and around. Sometimes he acts like he’s the one under vow of silence and never answers the questions about his personal life.
- Ideals: values the loyalty to the coven, will do anything to serve his suzerain well
