It is dynasty based, where the ruler is chosen as the next of kin from the ruling dynasty, because by the tradition of blood mages, the ruler must be connected by blood to their predecessor. Since there are two ruling dynasties that usually switch in this position from time to time. The switch of dynasties is usually caused by the rising dissatisfaction with the ruler, when the other dynasty in line needs to react and have their successor challenge the ruler in a duel (of swords? of combat hemothysia? both?) and then successfully win the duel, then the initiation ritual can occur normally. Of course, for this duel to actually happen, the potential successor of the opposing dynasty has to actually pass some qualifications, and act out politically a bit more (bring the people to root for them). Not any rando can challenge the ruler, the ruler has better things to do lol.
Current ruling dynasty of today is Jahanara, and has been the ruling dynasty for over 9 generations as of now. The opposing dynasty Haurvarat hasn’t had a single competent successor yet, even though they keep printing babies all around. 
About 6 generations ago, the old royal hemothyst prophet has professed that there will come a successor from Haurvarat family who will not only become the ruler and change the dynasty cycle again, but also will be the first one to conquer the entire country of Nilamin, and under that ruler, everything will fall under the rule of blood mages. This prophecy hasn’t yet come true and the Jahanara family has become a bit drunk on their power, turning this compromised monarchy into a dictatorship of sorts.
