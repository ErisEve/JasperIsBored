- he/him, they/them, gender nonconforming, gay
- 26 human + 70 vampire years
- Birthday: unknown
- known/unknown power: coercion (convincing) / unknown to public
- Very judging, probably thinks million negative thoughts about you behind your back
- Quiet/introverted, rarely speaks and when he speaks, usually sounds cold
- Very much both superiority and inferiority complex at the same time 
- Relationships:
    *   He will never say aloud what he thinks about any of these people unless he thinks that could potentially benefit his cause
    - Searlas - hates him to hell and back, but at the same time, very much in love with him and this situation makes him frustrated
    - Synthra - thinks she’s ambitionless/directionless, but finds her tolerable and loves to gossip with her occasionally and vent to her about Searlas’ stupidity
    - Vitas - sees him as worthy opponent to Savardi’s rule
    - Daireann - sees her as worthy opponent to Savardi’s rule
    - Laplace - sees him as worthy opponent to Savardi’s rule
    - Silvinius - very suspicious of him, doesn’t know what he thinks or what he aspires and is very carefully trying to figure that out
    - Mireio - just partially heard about her from when she tried getting into the castle of Savardi and from Synthra, and he doesn’t have anything against her supremacist ideas, hatred and capital felony
- Ideals: wants Savardi to rule over all other vampire covens and then attack bloodmages with the army of all covens and spread the rule over bloodmages too; believes he’s better than Searlas in the position of suzerain
