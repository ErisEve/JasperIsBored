- light skin, freckles, young appearance.
- Her entire vampire family died, and as she was last in line to the throne, she is now the suzerain of Yrshi. As such, she is about to be wed to the suzerain of Nenthi, in a historical tradition of making an alliance between the islands.

- known power: nothing is yet known about her to the general population
- Relationships:
    - D - doesn't know her too much, but thinks she's intimidating and cool.
    - Gwynn - her handmaiden who she is closest to and knows her secrets.
    - Had an amicable relationship with the rest of her royal family but they weren't particularly close yet.
- Background: She was born into a small human merchant family. She was noticed by some vampires who are always on the lookout for potentials, and offered her family money if they present her to the suzerain, and they accepted. Her loyal nursemaid Gwynn followed her and became her most trusted handmaiden. She was found promising and turned by the suzerain Seneca. As she is very young she spent most of her days not particularly close to the rest of the royal family, although since she matured into despot they became somewhat closer. Unfortunately soon after, the entire royal family died under mysterious circumstances and she was the only heir. 
- Ideals: Justice - She wants to find out who killed her family and demand justice. Peace - she believes humans and vampires are equal. She doesn't have any thoughts on blood mages as she is too young and innocent to have had any encounters with any of them.
