**Searlas**
- he/him, cis, bisexual
- (his name reads as “SHAR-las”, weird form of name “Charles” lol)
- 28 human + 48 vampire years
- Birthday: Scythe 29th, 748 eop
- known/unknown power: high resilience / —
- Scatterbrained, sometimes even more simple minded than he seems, sometimes surprisingly intelligent; very immature behavior most of the time
- Catchphrase: “Come on, at least it’s not 20, amirite”
- Relationships:
    *   He’s actually pretty incredible in not judging people he didn’t meet, so he doesn’t have any opinion on characters he didn’t have an encounter with
    - Arix - his BAE, adores him, sees him as someone he can rely on emotionally and rationally (“if i fuck up, i know Arix will solve the problem”)
    - Synthra - his BAE, adores her, sees her as his partner in crime and usually tells her all his ADHD random ideas that come to mind, loves to spend quality time with her, treats her as his enabler (if Synthra allows me to pierce this death-sentenced prisoner with thousand swords through every hole on his body, I will gladly do so)
    - His other 17 lovers - casual fuck material
    - Daireann - boring old woman that doesn’t know how to have fun from time to time
    - Silvinius - prisoner of his own position, bcs Searlas never saw him ever having fun, which he immediately attributes to being imprisoned by the coven or rules
    - Laplace - creepy guy, yikes
    - Vitas - boring old man that doesn’t know how to have fun, but probably has more fun than Daireann
    - Mireio - stans her fashion, doesn’t judge her personality because he hasn’t yet met her, but very much judges the decision to kill her creator
- Ideals: wants to become the ruler of all vampire covens, but more than that, wants to have fun; loves his closest lovers, satraps and servants as his family
