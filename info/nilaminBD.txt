**Nilamin**
There are 6 vampire covens in Nilamin. They each have their own castle on a small island. Neighbouring human territories are split between covens so that each coven has their own human territory that they govern over. 
Relationships between all covens used to be very cordial. Long ago, the first Malefactor managed to strike a deal with the humans, and split most of the country into smaller territories that he gave to his most trusted advisors. They created the covens, and now the covens carry their names. In more recent history, there has been a lot more animosity between the covens.  
As nestlings don't have any real authority, they don't carry the name of the coven yet. When a vampire matures, he gains the name of the coven, and as a despot is simply referred to as [full name] from [coven]. Suzerain and satrap use the coven name as their last name  and can be referred to as [title] [first name] [coven name]. Suzerain can be referred to as [title] of [coven name] as there is only one. 
examples: Bob Johnson from Cariya, Satrap Mike Cariya and the Suzerain of Cariya are three people from different hierarchies. 
The castle is referred to as Cariya, the coven in general as Cariya, the Cariya coven, and associated human territories as Cariyan territories.
examples: When humans talk, one of them might simply say I live down in Cariya. He doesn't need to clarify Cariyan territories, as he is human and wouldn't live in the castle. Vampires always refer to the castle as Cariya and human land as Cariyan land or Cariyan territories.
