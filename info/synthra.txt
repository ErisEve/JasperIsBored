- Background: She was born in a small village in a family with too many children and too little means to support them. They worked in the field since they were young and helped out with household chores. With money slowly running out, her parents started trying to marry all their children off for better prospects. She absolutely refused as she had no desire for a husband or children, which her parents found sinful. Eventually, contrary to her desires, she was married off, although it didn't last long. Savardi the malefactor was awoken to help deal with a blood mage invasion, and he went through her village to drink blood, leaving dead bodies behind him. When everything ended, she was bitten but somehow got some vampire blood in her system and was the only survivor. On his way back to slumber, Savardi acknowledged her, and as she didn't stand down before him, he decided she had 'enough spite and sass' for Savardi, so he let her stay in the coven.
